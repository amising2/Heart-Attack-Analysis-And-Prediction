## Introduction
What is Heart Attack?

![Heart_attack_Intro](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3a4e885c-6beb-4453-9bf6-2ed6e173278c)

*The medical name of heart attack is “Myocardial infarction”.
*Heart attack in short; It is the occlusion of the vessel by plaque-like lesions filled with cholesterol and fat.
*The lesion is called abnormal conditions that occur in the organs where the disease is located.
*As a result of the blockage, the blood flow is completely cut off and a heart attack that can lead to death occurs.

## How to use the files in this repository?

The notebooks are grouped into the following categories:
 * ``data`` – heart_attack_prediction_dataset.csv data file from Kaggle Machine Learning dataset repository used in the notebooks
 * ``images`` – Image files used in Notebook and Project Description
 * ``notebook`` – Heart_attack_Predictions

## Conclusion

*Within the scope of the project, we first made the data set ready for Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)
*We performed Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA).
*We analyzed numerical and categorical variables within the scope of univariate analysis by using Distplot and Pie Chart graphics.
*Within the scope of bivariate analysis, we analyzed the variables among each other using FacetGrid, Count Plot, Pair Plot, Swarm plot, Box plot, and Heatmap graphics.
*We made the data set ready for the model. In this context, we struggled with missing and outlier values.
*We used four different algorithms in the model phase.
*We got 87% accuracy and 88% AUC with the Logistic Regression model.
*We got 83% accuracy and 85% AUC with the Decision Tree Model.
*We got 83% accuracy and 89% AUC with the Support Vector Classifier Model. And we got 90.3% accuracy and 93% AUC with the Random Forest Classifier Model.
*When all these model outputs are evaluated, we prefer the model we created with the Random Forest Algorithm, which gives the best results
