#### Executive summary

What is Heart Attack?¶
![](../images/Heart_attack_Intro.jpeg)

The medical name of heart attack is “Myocardial infarction”.
Heart attack in short; It is the occlusion of the vessel by plaque-like lesions filled with cholesterol and fat.
The lesion is called abnormal conditions that occur in the organs where the disease is located.
As a result of the blockage, the blood flow is completely cut off and a heart attack that can lead to death occurs.
How does a heart attack occur?

The heart is a powerful pump that pumps blood throughout the body 60-80 times per minute at rest.
While meeting the blood needs of the whole body, it also needs to be fed and taken blood.
These vessels that feed the heart itself are called coronary arteries.
Coronary insufficiency occurs when there is a disruption in the circulation of the coronary arteries.
The cases of coronary insufficiency vary according to the type, degree and location of the stenosis in the coronary vessels.
While some patients may have chest pain that occurs only during physical activity and is relieved by rest, sometimes a heart attack may occur as a result of sudden occlusion of the vessels, starting with severe chest pain and leading to sudden death.
What are the symptoms of a heart attack?
Typical Symptoms:
Chest pain or discomfort: Often described as pressure, tightness, squeezing, or fullness in the center or left side of the chest.

Pain in other areas: May spread to shoulders, arms (especially left), back, neck, jaw, or stomach.

Shortness of breath: May occur with or without chest pain.

Cold sweat

Nausea or vomiting

Lightheadedness or dizziness

Fatigue: Especially in women, who may also have more subtle symptoms.

Note on Atypical Symptoms (especially in women, elderly, or diabetics):
Unusual fatigue

Indigestion or heartburn

Anxiety or a sense of doom

Pain in the jaw or back without chest pain






#### Conclusion

Within the scope of the project, we first made the data set ready for Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)
We performed Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA).
We analyzed numerical and categorical variables within the scope of univariate analysis by using Distplot and Pie Chart graphics.
Within the scope of bivariate analysis, we analyzed the variables among each other using FacetGrid, Count Plot, Pair Plot, Swarm plot, Box plot, and Heatmap graphics.
We made the data set ready for the model. In this context, we struggled with missing and outlier values.
We used four different algorithms in the model phase.
We got 87% accuracy and 88% AUC with the Logistic Regression model.
We got 83% accuracy and 85% AUC with the Decision Tree Model.
We got 83% accuracy and 89% AUC with the Support Vector Classifier Model. And we got 90.3% accuracy and 93% AUC with the Random Forest Classifier Model.
When all these model outputs are evaluated, we prefer the model we created with the Random Forest Algorithm, which gives the best results.
